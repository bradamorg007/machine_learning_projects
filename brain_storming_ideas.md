# BRAIN STORM

# Idea 1:
    
    Can we use autoencoders to compress a the infomation in a database down into a lower dimensional representation. these vectors 
    will take less amounts of memory to store. can use the decoder to retrive information like sql request and use vector maths
    to locate desired information based on request
    
# Idea 2:

    Can we use a the audio files from fallout 4s character voices to train a GAN. we could use the latent space representations because
    they are continous to produce new voices. would ther be away to isolate the dimesnions that words are represented to allow a user
    to type in a desired script line and have the GAN overlay a new voice to those words. Would it be possible to then discover new
    vectors that encode tone, emotion, volume, pace for example and use these axis to overally these quilities into the newly created voice.
    developers could programatically create npc voices and program emotional information into it.
